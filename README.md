2023.12.5 night: Add some comments.

2023.12.6 night: Changed to C++ files, In the Windows 11, Visual Studio 2019 environment, the code is normal and all functions are normal. There are only two problems. One is that the FindContact and SortContact functions can't be enabled and can only be commented out first(In C++, the code is //some words). The other is that the files to be opened and saved are placed on the E drisk, so if the computer doesn't have E disk, an error is going to occur.

2023.12.7: In VS2019, Windows 11, it's no problems.What needs to be solved for the time being is how to perform file operations under Mac system.
